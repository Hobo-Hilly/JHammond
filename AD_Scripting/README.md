# This series is a little all over the place so I am just going to grab stuff I can use in Chunks. John has already added his work station to the XYZ domain we set up in the previous video. However I do not have the hardware neccessary to run a home lab that would be of any real value. But I can use the scripts and code in this series to assit me in later on ventures. So theres a little context as to why these notes might come out looking a touch deformed.
# These scripts are going to help us create active directory Groups and Active directory Useres. This is basically prep work for when I get a better machine. 

# NOTE: The management system in this virtual network is NOT joined to the XYZ DOMAIN but as we found out in the last video we are able to remote using powershell.
