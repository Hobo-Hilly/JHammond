In this series I will be following the John Hammond Windows Active Directory series via YouTube.
I do not have the resources he has so my resource allocation will be different
He is using VM-Workstation pro. I will be using windows Hyper-V
My computers core does not support Windows 11 So I will be using windows 10 as a Work Station
